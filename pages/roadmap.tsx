          <h1>Roadmap</h1>
          <p>
            In our technical roadmap, we outline the required minimum to launch Communa as a product and generate revenue through a <strong>5% fee</strong> on freelancer income.
            The platform operates within a framework where freelancers are paid on a weekly basis.
          </p>

          <br />
          <h3>Here is the workflow:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Freelancers and clients connect on the website - <a href="https://communa.network/">https://communa.network</a>.</li>
            <li>Clients publish job listings and assign them to freelancers.</li>
            <li>Freelancers select the assigned job on our TimeTracker and log their unconfirmed working hours.</li>
            <li>Clients review and confirm the freelancer&#39;s work using our smart contract system.</li>
            <li>Freelancers receive payment after deducting a 5% commission.</li>
            <li>The paid hours are securely stored on the blockchain, contributing to the freelancer&#39;s reputation.</li>
            <li>Communa retains a 5% commission from the freelancer&#39;s income.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This workflow relies on <strong>a website</strong> that gives access to job publishing, freelance search, timesheets, and reports; <strong>a time tracker</strong> desktop app to track automatically time spent while working; and <strong>smart contracts</strong> for instant payment processing of stable coins like USDT.</p>
